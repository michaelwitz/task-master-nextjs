### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/kanban_db
   ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify database migrations have been run

**Drag and Drop Not Working**

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure you're not in edit mode (drag is disabled when editing)
- Verify the task card is not being blocked by other elements

**User Search Not Working**

- Ensure test data has been seeded: `npx tsx scripts/seed-users.ts`
- Check that users exist in the database
- Verify the search is case-insensitive

**Performance Issues**

- The sparse numbering algorithm should handle hundreds of tasks efficiently
- If experiencing slowdowns, check for infinite loops in React components
- Monitor database query performance

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review the Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
3. Verify all prerequisites are installed
4. Ensure database migrations and seeding completed successfully
