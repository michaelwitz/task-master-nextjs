# Project Code & Description Feature Setup

This update adds **Project Codes** and **Descriptions** to your task management system.

## ‚ú® New Features

- **Project Code**: Unique, immutable ALL CAPS identifier (max 10 characters)
- **Description**: Rich markdown editor for project details and objectives  
- **Enhanced UI**: Warnings about code immutability, better form layouts
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate codes and invalid characters

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Fresh Database Reset (Recommended for Testing)

If you want to start completely fresh with sample data:

```bash
# First add the new database columns
npx tsx scripts/add-missing-columns.ts

# Then reset and populate with sample data
npx tsx scripts/reset-and-seed.ts
```

### Option 2: Add Columns to Existing Data

If you want to keep your existing data and just add the new columns:

```bash
# Add the new code and description columns
npx tsx scripts/add-missing-columns.ts

# Manually update existing projects to add codes via the UI
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: With Option 2, existing projects will have a default code of "TEMP" that you'll need to update manually.

### What the Reset Script Does:
- ‚úÖ Clear all existing data (users, projects, tasks, tags, images)
- ‚úÖ Populate with 5 sample users
- ‚úÖ Create 5 sample projects with codes and markdown descriptions
- ‚úÖ Generate 17 sample tasks across all projects
- ‚úÖ Maintain all relationships and constraints
